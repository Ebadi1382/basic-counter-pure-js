# Basic Counter – Pure JavaScript

A very simple **counter project** built with **Pure JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
I created this project **just to review and practice basic JavaScript concepts**.  
It’s not meant to be a production-level app, but if you’re new to JavaScript,  
you might find it helpful as a small reference.
